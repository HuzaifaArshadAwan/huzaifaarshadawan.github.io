      They say that couples are made in heaven. Our couple is an example of that. Hamza and Huzaifa have been best friends for the last 16 years. Indeed, they have grown up together. They were interested in music from the beginning, and have been making music together for over 13 years now. Dili Naghmay is their latest venture. Our music is availble on the following platforms.
